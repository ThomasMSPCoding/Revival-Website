            <p>Bought it in ‘22. Bone stock. Just another forgotten ‘96 EJ9, sitting under rain-soaked skies, collecting rust like stories. People said it was nothing special. But I saw it, the lines, the stance, the potential. A sleeping outlaw.</p>
            <p>Since then, it’s been blood, sweat, and burned knuckles. Welding through midnight, wrenching until sunrise. Rust? Cut it out. Engine? Reborn. Every bolt turned by hand, every scar on this car tells part of my story. It’s not just a machine, it’s a canvas forged in oil and adrenaline.</p>
            <p>Now? This Civic bites in corners. It dances on apexes with the soul of Osaka’s underground. A tribute. A whisper from the past. A nod to the Kanjozoku, where speed wasn’t for fame, but for pride. This build isn’t about trophies. It’s about respect.</p>
            <p>Most people don’t get it. To them, it’s just an old car. But to the few who feel it deep, who smell the fuel and hear the call, this is a <i>lifestyle</i>.</p>

            <p>They call it Yasei.
A 6th Gen Civic, one preowner, untouched. Just 75 horses hiding in a tired D14, barely breathing, barely surviving.</p>
            <p>But we saw past the quiet. Past the stock ride height, the faded plastics, the innocent 1.4 badge. We saw a future fighter. So we tore it down,piece by piece, bolt by bolt, and began the resurrection.</p>
            <p>No shortcuts. No fakes. Just long nights, cold garages, and busted knuckles.</p>
            <p>Yasei is no longer the Civic it once was.
It’s evolving, chassis reinforced, safety dialed in, gearing up to unleash something most would underestimate: a D-series weapon built for the mountain passes and tight lines</p>
            <p><b>Touge. Track. Respect.</b>
This car’s not just being built — it’s being forged.</p>

            <p>The black Subaru Impreza, once a shadow of its former self, stood there, ready for a rebirth. Under the hood slumbered the legendary EJ20 boxer engine, its heart now burning to beat once more. Every bolt, every line was touched with dedication, polished, and reassembled. It was a dance of sweat, blood, and countless hours of hard work that went into this project.</p>
            <p>The body, once marked by the scars of the road, now gleamed in new splendor. The deep black paint reflected the determination with which this car was brought back to life. The EJ20 roared to life, a deep rumble that promised to shake the streets once again.</p>
            <p>And then, the moment of truth: The Impreza rolled onto the street, ready to fill the world again with its presence. A symbol of perseverance, passion, and the unbridled love for the automobile. The streets trembled under its thunderous appearance, proof that true legends never die.</p>

            <p>That’s Iggy, the Civic on the right. Once paired with a long-lost friend, he’s still rolling with a loyal 1.3L heart. Not fast yet, but full of character, lowered and barking through aftermarket pipes. For five years, he’s been more than a car: a quiet escape, a late-night ride, a reminder that imperfect things can still be loved. A new engine’s coming. He knows it. Just listen to him idle. This isn’t just a build, it’s a bond.</p>
