            <p>Bought it in ‘22. Bone stock. Just another forgotten ‘96 EJ9, sitting under rain-soaked skies, collecting rust like stories. People said it was nothing special. But I saw it, the lines, the stance, the potential. A sleeping outlaw.</p>
            <p>Since then, it’s been blood, sweat, and burned knuckles. Welding through midnight, wrenching until sunrise. Rust? Cut it out. Engine? Reborn. Every bolt turned by hand, every scar on this car tells part of my story. It’s not just a machine, it’s a canvas forged in oil and adrenaline.</p>
            <p>Now? This Civic bites in corners. It dances on apexes with the soul of Osaka’s underground. A tribute. A whisper from the past. A nod to the Kanjozoku, where speed wasn’t for fame, but for pride. This build isn’t about trophies. It’s about respect.</p>
            <p>Most people don’t get it. To them, it’s just an old car. But to the few who feel it deep, who smell the fuel and hear the call, this is a <i>lifestyle</i>.</p>

            <p>They call it Yasei.
A 6th Gen Civic, one preowner, untouched. Just 75 horses hiding in a tired D14, barely breathing, barely surviving.</p>
            <p>But we saw past the quiet. Past the stock ride height, the faded plastics, the innocent 1.4 badge. We saw a future fighter. So we tore it down,piece by piece, bolt by bolt, and began the resurrection.</p>
            <p>No shortcuts. No fakes. Just long nights, cold garages, and busted knuckles.</p>
            <p>Yasei is no longer the Civic it once was.
It’s evolving, chassis reinforced, safety dialed in, gearing up to unleash something most would underestimate: a D-series weapon built for the mountain passes and tight lines</p>
            <p><b>Touge. Track. Respect.</b>
This car’s not just being built — it’s being forged.</p>

            <p>That’s Iggy, the Civic on the right. He used to ride alongside his best friend, another old soul now lost to rust and memory. Iggy’s still here though, still holding it down with a 1.3 liter heart that’s more loyal than powerful. He’s not fast, not yet. But there’s something about the way he carries himself, lowered just enough, barking through aftermarket headers and an exhaust that lets him speak louder than he should. For five years, he’s been more than just a car. He’s been a quiet companion, a late-night escape, a reminder that not everything worth keeping has to be perfect. Now he's on the edge of change. A new heart is coming, something stronger, something wild. You can feel it in the way he hums at idle, like he knows what’s ahead. Look at him. How could you not love that face? This isn’t just a build. It’s a bond. And in a world that moves too fast, Iggy’s proof that sometimes the slowest rides carry the heaviest stories.</p>
